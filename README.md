# data-visualization-challenge
I had a lot of trouble with this assignment because my plot figures kept stacking on each other throughout the workbook and I couldn't figure out why or how to fix it. Any help or clarity would be very appreciated! I got to a point where I couldn't move on to the end because of the error/mistake. 

I referenced all these pages to help when I was stuck in this assignment.
